# Vesta — Where Ambition Meets Comfort

Vesta is a women-first dating app concept designed for **ambitious, homebody women** who want equally ambitious men.  
Think **LinkedIn + Netflix + Raya**: verified ambition, cozy lifestyle alignment, and exclusivity.

---

## 🌟 Vision

Most dating apps optimize for engagement and swipes, not for meaningful matches.  
Ambitious women — often with multiple degrees and strong careers — get flooded with low-effort, low-quality matches.

Vesta flips the script:

- **Women-first by design** → safe, curated, and exclusive.
- **Career + lifestyle alignment** → LinkedIn-style verification meets cozy, homebody vibes.
- **Quality over quantity** → AI-powered compatibility, not endless swiping.

---

## ✨ Key Features (Planned)

- **Verified Profiles** — LinkedIn sync, lifestyle preferences, optional badges.
- **Women-First Safety** — curated invites, limited intros, respectful engagement.
- **Smart Matching** — AI that considers ambition, goals, education, and lifestyle.
- **Cozy Experiences** — built-in “date night” features (co-watch, cook-alongs, book swaps).
- **Exclusivity** — invite-only waitlist to maintain quality.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (MVP)

- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS (deployed on Vercel)
- **Backend (planned):** Node.js + GraphQL + Postgres
- **AI Matching:** embeddings for compatibility + LLM-powered conversation starters
- **Infra:** Docker, potential AWS/GCP deployment
- **Design:** Inter (UI) + Playfair Display (brand headlines), lavender + gold accents

I’m looking for:

- 🎨 Product Designer — elegant UI/UX, brand identity.
- 📱 Mobile Developer — React Native or iOS/Android.
- 📈 Growth/Partnerships Lead — launch strategy, community, PR.
